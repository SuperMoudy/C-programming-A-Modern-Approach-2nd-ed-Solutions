// Q1

/*
 * Depending on your OS and your toolchain
 *
 * If you are using windows, probably you are using MinGW, Cygwin, ...etc.
 * Default path: C:\<your_toolchain>\lib\gcc\<target>\
 *
 * If you are using linux, you can locate gcc header files starting with these paths:
 * usr/include/
 * usr/lib/gcc/
 *
 *
 * We know which headers are standard, otherwise are non-standard.

//----------------------------------

// Q2

/*
 * In <stdio.h> using windows and MinGW: The function getwc is hidden by a macro
 *
 * Line 775: wint_t __cdecl getwc(FILE *_File);
 * Line 866: #define getwc(_stm) fgetwc(_stm)
 *
 *
 */

//----------------------------------

// Q3

/*
 *
 * The function prototype should appear first so that the preprocessor knows
 * what function is being hidden by the macro. If the macro was to be added
 * first, macro expansions would be done later to the function declaration
 * and sytax errors arise.
 *

//----------------------------------

// Q4

/*
 * The following names are grouped under individual headers for convenience.
 * All external names described below are reserved no matter what headers
 * are included by the program:
 *
 * - Complex arithmetic <complex.h>:
 * cerf    cerfc    cexp2    cexpm1    clog10    clog1p    clog2    clgamma    ctgamma
 *
 * and the same names suffixed with f or l may be added to the declarations
 * in the <complex.h> header.
 *
 *
 * - Character handling <ctype.h>:
 * > Function names that begin with either is or to, and a lowercase letter
 * may be added to the declarations in the <ctype.h> header.
 *
 *
 * - Errors <errno.h>:
 * > Macros that begin with E and a digit or E and an uppercase letter
 * may be added to the declarations in the <errno.h> header.
 *
 *
 * - Format conversion of integer types <inttypes.h>:
 * > Macro names beginning with PRI or SCN followed by any lowercase letter
 * or X may be added to the macros defined in the <inttypes.h> header.
 *
 *
 * - Localization <locale.h>:
 * > Macros that begin with LC_ and an uppercase letter may be added to the
 * definitions in the <locale.h> header.
 *
 *
 * - Signal handling <signal.h>:
 * > Macros that begin with either SIG and an uppercase letter or SIG_ and
 * an uppercase letter may be added to the definitions in the <signal.h> header.
 *
 *
 * - Boolean type and values <stdbool.h>:
 * > The ability to undefine and perhaps then redefine the macros bool, true,
 * and false is an obsolescent feature.
 *
 *
 * - Integer types <stdint.h>:
 * > Typedef names beginning with int or uint and ending with _t may be added
 * to the types defined in the <stdint.h> header. Macro names beginning with
 * INT or UINT and ending with _MAX, _MIN, or _C may be added to the macros
 * defined in the <stdint.h> header.
 *
 *
 * - Input/output <stdio.h>:
 * > Lowercase letters may be added to the conversion specifiers and length
 * modifiers in fprintf and fscanf. Other characters may be used in extensions.
 *
 * > The use of ungetc on a binary stream where the file position indicator
 * is zero prior to the call is an obsolescent feature.
 *
 *
 *
 * - General utilities <stdlib.h>:
 * > Function names that begin with str and a lowercase letter may be added to
 * the declarations in the <stdlib.h> header.
 *
 *
 * - String handling <string.h>:
 * > Function names that begin with str, mem, or wcs and a lowercase letter may be
 * added to the declarations in the <string.h> header.
 *
 *
 * - Extended multibyte and wide character utilities <wchar.h>:
 * > Function names that begin with wcs and a lowercase letter may be added to
 * the declarations in the <wchar.h> header.
 *
 * > Lowercase letters may be added to the conversion specifiers and length modifiers
 * in fwprintf and fwscanf. Other characters may be used in extensions.
 *
 *
 * - Wide character classification and mapping utilities <wctype.h>:
 * > Function names that begin with is or to and a lowercase letter may be added
 * to the declarations in the <wctype.h> header.

// Q5

/*
 * Because according to the C standard, a parameterized macro that substitutes
 * for a library function must be "fully protected" by parentheses and must
 * evaluate its arguments exactly once but the given
 * macro is neither fully protected nor evaluates its argument twice which may lead
 * to problems.
 *
 */

//----------------------------------

// Q6

/*
 * a) Because these types of identifiers (beginning with underscore) are reserved
 * for use only within libraries and according to the C standard, macros appearing
 * in a standard header can't be redefined if the header is included. So it's kind of
 * restriction and protection to these macros.
 *
 *
 * b) _ctype array will contain a bit-field of length 8 bits (unsigned char)
 * corresponding to theproperties of each character in the ASCII character set.
 *
 * Horizontal-tab character:
 * _ctype[9] = _CONTROL | _SPACE | _BLANK = 0x08 | 0x20 | 0x80
 *           = 0000_1000 | 0010_0000 | 1000_0000 = 1010_1000 = 0xA8 = 168
 *
 * Space character:
 * _ctype[32] = _SPACE | _BLANK = 0x20 | 0x80 = 0010_0000 | 1000_0000
 *            = 1010_0000 = 0xA0 = 160
 *
 * Letter A:
 * _ctype[65] = _UPPER = 0x01 = 1
 *
 * ^ character:
 * _ctype[94] = _PUNCT = 0x10 = 16
 *
 *
 *
 * c) Advantage: Fast searching and evaluation of parameter will be done once
 * (meeting the c standard conditions)
